5-1 ( 4-1 )	thermodynamic temperature fr température  (f)  thermo- dynamique	T  , ( Θ )	one of the base quantities in the International System of Quantities, ISQ, on which the International System of Units, SI, is based	Thermodynamic temperature is the   quantity   that   is   measured   with a primary thermometer, examples of which are constant volume gas thermometers, acoustic thermometers, or total radiation   thermometers.	5-1.a	kelvin	K	unit of thermodynamic temperature that is the fraction 1/273,16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water	The units of thermodynamic and Celsius temperature difference or change are identical. Such differences or changes may be expressed either in kelvins, symbol K, or in degrees Celsius, symbol,  ◦ C. It should be noted that the symbol   ◦ C   for   the   degree   Celsius shall be preceded by a space (see  ISO 80000-1:2009 , 7.1.4). The International Temperature Scale of 1990 For the purpose of practical measurements, the International Temperature Scale of 1990, ITS-90, was adopted by CIPM in 1989. The quantities corresponding to thermodynamic temperature and Celsius temperature defined by this scale are denoted  T 90  and  t 90 , respectively (replacing  T 68  and  t 68  defined by the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968, IPTS-68), where t 90  =   T 90  −   T 0 The units of  T 90  and  t 90  are the kelvin, symbol K, and the degree Celsius, symbol  ◦ C, respectively. For further information, see: The International Temperature  Scale of 1990 (ITS-90),  Metrologia ,  27 (1990), No. 1.
