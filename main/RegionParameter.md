# Parameter

The Parameter region has 4 classes which, together, define the physical parameters. These consist of a "MIP Variable" class which is an aggregation of a "Units" class and a "Standard Name" class, and a classifier.

There is a constraint of consistency bewteen the Units attribute specified by the classifier and the Canonical Units of the Standard Name. 

## StandardName

The StandardName class represents the definition of a CF Standard Name. This is instantiated by importing content from the CF Standard Name table,

### label

The term itself: a string defined by the CF Standard Name table, e.g. `air_temperature`.

### title

A string generated automatically from the standard name, with spaces replacing underscores.

### canonical_units

A valid CF unit of measure. The CF Convention states that any variable which uses this standard
name must have units conforming to the Canonical Units associated with the term. 

In ISO 80000 terminology, the dimensionality must match.

### description

A description of the term. This may be autogenerated based on definitions of components of the standard name.

## Units

All units used are listed. 

### label

A nmonic string identifying the instance.

### title

### value

Specification of the string in the form `m s-1`: i.e. space separated list of base units, each optionally modied by a power.

### dimensionality [NEW]

To aid alignment with ISO 80000, a dimensionality in the sense of ISO 80000 is added.
